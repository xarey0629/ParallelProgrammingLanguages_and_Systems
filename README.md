# This repository works on multi-threaded programming in C using pthread.
## Problems:
1. Developed a parallel prefix sum algorithm by **shared-memory** and thread **synchronization** techniques, e.g. **monitor, barrier**.
2. Created a file copy program using **pipe** and shared-memory mechanism as a /**producer-consumer** realization.
3. Executed multi-threaded parallel merge-sort and synchronization to handle command-line user input.
4. Implemented pthread **mutex** to synchronize 5 threads and prevent data inconsistency, realizing Monte Carloâ€™s algorithm.
